# Weather Application

The weather application is made of two parts, the website (written in React/TypeScript) and the backend api (written in express Node JS).

## Environment

Before getting started, rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and change the port variables as required.

## Dependencies

Both the backend and the frontend will assume that you have Node v16 installed on your machine.

## Getting Started (Backend)

To get started in the backend, navigate to the api folder.

`cd api`

Then install the required packages.

`npm install`

Once installation is done, run the application using the command below. The api will default to port 5000. This can be modified by changing the port variable in the api/environment.js file.

`npm run start`

Once the backend application is running, we can move on to the website.

## Getting Started (Website)

To get started in the website, navigate to the api folder.

`cd web`

Then install the required packages.

`npm install`

Once the dependencies are done installing, run the web application using the following command:

`npm run start`

A web browser should open up at http://localhost:3000. The web application is now running.
